Product Backlog Development for a Hotel System (Simple Explanation)
1. What is a Product Backlog and Its Purpose?

A product backlog is a list of all features, improvements, and fixes that need to be done to build the hotel software.
It is created and maintained by the Product Owner.
Its purpose is to make sure the development team always knows what to build next, starting from the most important features.
It helps keep the project organized, transparent, and aligned with business needs.

2. How to Create and Structure a Product Backlog

To create a product backlog for a hotel system:

Gather requirements
Talk to hotel staff, managers, receptionists, and customers to understand what they need (booking, billing, rooms, etc.).

Write user stories
Use simple statements like:
“As a guest, I want to book a room online so that I can reserve my stay easily.”

Break down large tasks
Big features such as "Room Booking" can be broken into smaller tasks like:

Search for rooms

Select dates

Add guest details

Confirm payment

Organize the backlog
Group items by hotel modules such as:

Room Booking

Check-in/Check-out

Billing

Housekeeping

Reports

Add details gradually
Items at the top are more detailed.
Items at the bottom can be brief and expanded later.

3. Backlog Prioritization Techniques

To decide what should be done first, the Product Owner can use:

MoSCoW Method
Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won’t-have.

Value vs. Effort
Choose items that give high value but require low effort.

Business Value Ranking
Features most needed by the hotel (e.g., room booking) are placed at the top.

Risk-based Prioritization
Features that reduce risk or uncertainty get done earlier.

Stakeholder Input
Hotel manager and staff help identify what is most important.

4. Backlog Refinement and Maintenance

Backlog refinement (also called grooming) keeps the backlog clean and updated.

It includes:

Reviewing items regularly
Remove outdated or unnecessary features.

Adding new requirements
If the hotel asks for new features, add them.

Updating priorities
Move high-value items to the top.

Improving user stories
Add acceptance criteria, clarify details, and adjust estimates.

Breaking large items into smaller ones
This helps the team plan more accurately.

Refinement is usually done every week or during each sprint.
