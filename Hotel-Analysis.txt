Analysis Phase in Software Development (Hotel System)

Definition and Importance:
The analysis phase is the stage in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where requirements are gathered, studied, and documented to ensure the system meets the business and user needs. For a hotel system, this phase ensures features like room booking, check-in/check-out, billing, and customer management are properly understood before development begins. Its importance lies in reducing errors, avoiding costly changes later, and creating a clear roadmap for design and implementation.

Sub-Steps in the Analysis Phase:

Requirement Gathering: Collect information from stakeholders (hotel staff, managers, customers) through interviews, surveys, or observation to understand what the system should do.

Requirement Analysis: Examine gathered requirements for feasibility, conflicts, and completeness. For a hotel system, check how booking workflows, payment methods, and reporting will work.

Requirement Specification: Document functional requirements (room booking, payments, reports) and non-functional requirements (security, performance, usability).

System Modeling: Create models like use case diagrams, data flow diagrams, or workflow charts to visualize processes such as reservations, cancellations, and inventory management.

Validation & Approval: Review requirements with stakeholders to confirm accuracy and completeness before moving to the design phase.

Deliverables and Outcomes:

Requirement Specification Document (RSD): Detailed documentation of all functional and non-functional requirements.

System Models: Diagrams representing workflows, data, and interactions.

Feasibility Report: Analysis of technical, operational, and financial feasibility.

Approved Requirements: Stakeholder-signed requirements ensuring alignment with business needs.

Best Practices:

Involve all key stakeholders early and continuously.

Prioritize requirements based on business value and urgency.

Maintain clear and structured documentation.

Use visual models to simplify complex processes.

Common Challenges:

Unclear or changing requirements from stakeholders.

Communication gaps between technical teams and hotel staff.

Overlooking non-functional requirements like system security or performance.

Scope creep due to additional features requested after analysis.
