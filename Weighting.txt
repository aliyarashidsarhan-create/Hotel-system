Weighting and Estimation for a Hotel System (Simple Explanation)

Weighting and estimation help teams understand how big, how complex, and how valuable each user story is before development begins. This allows better planning, scheduling, and prioritization.

1. Story Point Estimation Techniques (Simple Explanation)

Story points measure the effort needed to complete a user story.
They are not hours — instead, they consider:

Complexity

Amount of work

Risks or unknowns

Common scales:

Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13…)

Small = 1–3, Medium = 5–8, Large = 13+

Example in a hotel system:

“Search available rooms” → 3 points (simple)

“Online payment integration” → 8 points (complex)

2. Estimation Methods (Simple and Common)
a) Planning Poker

Each team member gets cards with numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.).

The user story is discussed.

Everyone secretly selects a card.

All cards are revealed at the same time.

If the numbers vary a lot, the team discusses why and estimates again.

Good for: teamwork, removing bias, improving accuracy.

b) T-Shirt Sizing

User stories are grouped into size categories:
XS, S, M, L, XL

Example:

“View room details” → S

“Room booking confirmation email system” → M

“Build full billing system” → XL

Good for: early rough estimation.

c) Bucket System

Stories are placed into “buckets” such as 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.

The team quickly sorts stories based on similarity.

Good for: estimating many stories at once.

d) Affinity Estimation

All user stories are placed on a wall or board.

Team members group similar-sized stories together.

Story points are assigned after grouping.

Good for: large backlogs and fast estimation.

3. How to Weight User Stories (Simple Approach)

Weighting means scoring each story based on:

a) Complexity

Ask:

Is the logic simple or complicated?

Does it involve external systems?

Does it require calculations or major validation?

Example:

“Check room availability” → Low complexity

“Integrate with third-party payment gateway” → High complexity

b) Priority

Priority means how urgent or important the story is for the hotel system.

Ask:

Is it needed for launch?

Does it support a core hotel function?

Can the system work without it?

Example:

Booking rooms → High priority

Loyalty points feature → Low priority

c) Business Value

Business value means how much the story helps:

Increase revenue

Improve customer satisfaction

Reduce staff work

Support hotel operations

Example:

“Online booking and payment” → High value (brings income)

“Social media sharing feature” → Low value

Summary (Very Simple)

Story points measure effort.

Use methods like Planning Poker, T-shirt sizing, and Affinity estimation.

Weight stories by:

Complexity → hard or easy

Priority → urgent or not

Business value → important for hotel success

This helps the team build the hotel system faster, smarter, and with better planning.
