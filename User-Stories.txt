1. What Are User Stories and Their Format?

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the user’s point of view.
They help the development team understand what the user needs and why they need it.

Standard format:

As a [type of user], I want [feature], so that [benefit].

Examples for a hotel system:

As a guest, I want to book a room online so that I can reserve my stay easily.

As a receptionist, I want to check room availability so that I can assist guests quickly.

As a manager, I want to view daily reports so that I can monitor hotel performance.

2. How to Write Effective User Stories

To write good user stories, follow these principles:

a. Keep them short and clear

The story should be simple enough for anyone to understand.

b. Focus on the user

Always write from the user’s perspective, not the system’s.

c. Include a clear goal

Explain what the user wants to do.

d. Explain the purpose

Always include the “so that…” part — it shows the real value.

e. Avoid technical language

Focus on needs, not solutions.
Example: Say “I want to check in guests quickly” instead of “I want an optimized API endpoint.”

f. Make each story independent

Each story should stand on its own.

g. Ensure it is small enough to complete in one sprint

If it is too big, break it down into smaller stories.

3. Acceptance Criteria and Their Importance

Acceptance criteria are statements that define the conditions a user story must meet to be considered complete.

They answer the question:
“How will we know the story is done?”

Why acceptance criteria are important:

Clarify requirements: Everyone understands exactly what needs to be built.

Avoid misunderstandings: Prevents confusion between developers, testers, and stakeholders.

Support testing: Testers can verify if the story works as intended.

Ensure quality: Helps developers know when the functionality is correct.

Define boundaries: Prevents unnecessary extra work or wrong assumptions.

Example for a hotel system:

User Story:
As a guest, I want to book a room online so that I can reserve my stay easily.

Acceptance Criteria:

The system should allow selecting check-in and check-out dates.

The system should show available rooms for the selected dates.

The user should be able to complete the booking with personal details.

The system should confirm the booking with a message or email.
